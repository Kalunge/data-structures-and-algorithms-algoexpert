## Complexrity analysis
### Time complexity
- how fast an algorithm runs -> the faster the better
#### Memory
- [
  0  | 1  | 2  | 3
  4  | 5  | 6  | 7
  8  | 9  | 10 | 11
  12 | 13 | 14 | 15
  16 | 17 | 18  | 19
]

### 
a = [1,2,3 ...]
- change of speed of an algorithm with change in input size
##### O(1) 
  - Remains constant with increase in input
- f(a) => 1 + a[o]
##### O(N) 
  - Increases linearly with increase in input size
- f(a) => sum(a)
##### O(N2) 
- f(a) => pair(a)
  - 


### Space complexity
- what space/memory takes -> The less the better
- 

### Space-Time complexity

- Aim to choose the best DS with the best space and time complexity
